# Brain-MRI-Tumor-detection
Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Images
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The dataset contains images labeled as either "tumor" or "healthy." The goal is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify these images accurately.

Introduction
Brain tumors are serious medical conditions that can be life-threatening. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to develop a reliable system for automatically detecting tumors in MRI scans using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains MRI images categorized into two classes:

Tumor: Images containing tumors.
Healthy: Images without tumors.
The dataset is organized as follows:

data/
    ├── no/
    │   └── (healthy images)
    └── yes/
        └── (tumor images)
Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary packages. You can install the required packages using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python torch torchvision
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
Update the paths to your dataset in the code.
Run the main script to train the CNN model.
python main.py
Model Architecture
The model is built using PyTorch and consists of the following layers:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Activation functions (Tanh, ReLU) for introducing non-linearity.
Pooling layers for downsampling.
Fully connected layers for classification.
Results
The model is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. You can visualize the training and validation results using Matplotlib.
